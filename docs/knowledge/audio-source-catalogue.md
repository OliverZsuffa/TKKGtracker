# Shared audio source catalogue

## Canonical data

The episode array in `data/episodes.json` remains the canonical shared TKKG dataset. Audio metadata is an optional `audio_release` object on an episode. The generated CSV includes this object as JSON text. Existing `listening_links` remain official listening hubs and are not interchangeable with exact Spotify album or YouTube Music playlist URLs.

## Verified audio object

An audio object is published only after every Spotify track has one unambiguous YouTube Music song match. Titles must match exactly after conservative Unicode, case, and punctuation normalization, with additional corroboration from the TKKG artist, episode album identity, or matching duration. A full YouTube Music playlist is stored as a second entry point when it can also be verified, but playlist discovery is optional.

- `spotify.album_id`, `spotify.url`, `spotify.title`, `spotify.track_count`, and `spotify.source_query`
- `youtube_music.tracks[]` stores the individual YouTube Music song URL, video ID, title, artists, album, duration, and match evidence for each Spotify track
- `youtube_music.playlist` stores the verified album playlist ID, URL, title, and track count when available; it is `null` when playlist discovery fails
- `youtube_music.track_count` is the count of individually verified song links
- `verification.status`, `verification.verified_at`, `verification.method`, and `verification.matched_track_count`

The Spotify track count, individual YouTube Music track count, and matched track count must agree. Playlist track count must also agree when a playlist is available. Song video IDs and playlist IDs must agree with their corresponding URLs. The schema rejects unverified status values and unknown fields.

## Discovery

Run `python -m scraper.audio_enrichment --episode 150` for a dry run. For a diagnostic or manual recovery, `--playlist-id OLAK...` can verify one explicitly supplied playlist with exactly one `--episode`; normal operation discovers the playlist automatically. Use `--write` only when verified results should be written to `data/episodes.json` and `data/episodes.csv`. Without an episode selector, `--limit N` processes at most N episodes that do not already have verified audio metadata.

Spotify metadata is resolved using spotDL's metadata save operation. YouTube Music candidates are searched using `ytmusicapi`. Album search results can expose an `MPRE...` browse ID; resolve these with `get_album()` and use the returned `audioPlaylistId` when available. Playlist results may expose an `OLAK...` ID directly or through a `VLOLAK...` browse ID. Their public playlist track lists are then retrieved. Individual song searches are primary. A candidate needs an exact normalized title plus corroborating evidence from the TKKG artist, matching episode album, or close duration. A unique best candidate is required. Missing or ambiguous songs stop publication for that episode. Playlist discovery runs independently as an optional convenience link. A playlist is stored only if its title, TKKG artist evidence, track count, and ordered track titles all match. Multiple fully matching playlist candidates are treated as ambiguous.

The current matching rule is intentionally conservative. It does not attempt fuzzy matching, alternate-edition selection, or automatic acceptance of bonus tracks. Such episodes remain unresolved for review.

## Provider limitations

`ytmusicapi` is an unofficial client that emulates public YouTube Music web requests. It is not supported or endorsed by Google and can break when the service changes. The discovery workflow uses unauthenticated public access and does not store browser cookies or account credentials. No authentication, access controls, or rate limits are bypassed.

spotDL reads Spotify metadata and uses the paired YouTube Music URL as the audio source. Its documented manual pairing format is `YouTubeMusicURL|SpotifyAlbumURL`. The downloader integration must confirm this against its installed spotDL version before relying on the dataset in production.

## Backfill and scheduled discovery

A weekly GitHub Actions run processes at most five highest-numbered episodes that do not yet have verified mappings. It writes only fully verified pairings. Manual workflow dispatch supports a specific episode or a bounded batch for historical backfill. The default manual mode is dry-run.

## Preservation

The normal episode scraper loads the previous catalogue and carries forward verified audio objects. Empty enrichment, provider failures, or changed mappings do not silently erase or replace an existing verified object. Conflicts are reported for review. The regular episode scrape remains independent of optional audio discovery.

## Downstream consumers

TKKGDownloader should fetch the published `episodes.json`, look up an episode by `number`, and use `audio_release` only when `verification.status` is `verified`. For a robust download, it should pair each `youtube_music.tracks[].url` with the Spotify album URL using spotDL's documented pipe-separated format. The optional `youtube_music.playlist.url` is an additional way to access the complete release, not a prerequisite for a verified mapping. Consumers are read-only and must not maintain separate playlist mappings.
